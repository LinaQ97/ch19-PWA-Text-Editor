# ch19-PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

In this challenge I had to create a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.
I had to start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database.
